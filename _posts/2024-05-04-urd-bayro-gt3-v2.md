The BMW M4 GT3 is the race car version of the BMW M4 (G82) and the direct successor of the BMW M6 GT3, racing from the 2022 season onwards. One of the biggest improvements in comparison to the M6 GT3 are in three areas: drivability, cost efficiency and operation. The M4 GT3's handling and cockpit equipment are made comfortable for amateur drivers, while the car is easier on the tires and offers greater consistency. Far lower lifecycle costs and longer maintenance intervals for the engine and transmission are vital economic factors. The M4 GT3 also saw participation in other racing series such as the 2022 Asian Le Mans Series and the Super GT in Japan.
