New for the 2021 Porsche Supercup season, the latest generation of Porsche 911 GT3 Cup car builds upon an existing and successful framework to create the next era of top-notch racing in Porsche's premier global one-make racing series. Kicking up the horsepower to 510 in its 4.0-liter flat-six powerplant, 25 more than its predecessor, the latest 911 GT3 Cup features improvements to chassis construction, aerodynamics, suspension, and safety features, and can be run on synthetic fuels for the first time. Do you have what it takes to master the machine and become the next great Porsche champion?
