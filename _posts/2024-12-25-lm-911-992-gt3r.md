The Porsche 992 GT3 R is the latest generation of the Porsche 911 GT3 R, a customer racing car designed for worldwide GT3 series. It is based on the current 992 generation of the iconic 911 platform and will be ready to race at the beginning of the 2023 season. The new model features a larger engine producing up to 565 HP (416 kW), more constant aerodynamic performance, and an optimized vehicle balance. The development of the new model began in 2019, with a focus on improving drivability for drivers with various skillsets, tapping larger performance reserves for different Balance of Performance (BoP) classifications, streamlining the handling of the race car for teams, and reducing running costs. The new 911 GT3 R is available to North American customers at a price of $567,210 and optional extras.
