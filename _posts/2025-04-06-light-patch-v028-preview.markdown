An extension for Assetto Corsa which started as an attempt to add some sort dynamic lighting, hence the name. Still in development, as usual.

**Weâ€™d like to thank the Kunos developers for all of the effort they put into making AC such a great simulator and giving us an excellent basis for our work.**
